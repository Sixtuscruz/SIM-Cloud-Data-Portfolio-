# Telemetry Data Mapping

This document describes the structure and meaning of telemetry data used by the
Event-Driven Cloud Security Alert Platform.

The data simulates operational and security events generated by cloud resources
across multiple regions.

## Telemetry Event Schema

| Field Name        | Type    | Description |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| eventId          | String  | Unique identifier for the telemetry event |
| timestamp        | DateTime| Time the event was generated |
| resourceId       | String  | Identifier of the affected cloud resource |
| region           | String  | Azure region where the event originated |
| riskScore        | Integer | Calculated risk score for the event |
| driftLevel       | Integer | Configuration drift indicator (0–100) |
| threatVelocity   | Integer | Frequency or rate of related events |
| eventType        | String  | Type of event detected |
| configurationState | String | Current configuration status |

## Field Usage in Detection Logic

| Field Name      | Used For |
|-----------------|----------|
| riskScore       | High-risk activity detection |
| driftLevel      | Misconfiguration detection |
| threatVelocity  | Anomaly detection |
| eventType       | Critical event classification |
| region          | Multi-region security analysis |

## Data Source

Telemetry data is synthetically generated for simulation purposes and does not represent
real production workloads.
